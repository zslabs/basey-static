# Basey Static

Basey is a developer-friendly static site boilerplate built with [UIkit](https://github.com/uikit/uikit) and [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com).

## Customization: Getting Started

* In your terminal, navigate to your site's directory and run the following:
  * `npm install`
    * Installs build modules and assets
  * `gulp`
     * Builds initial project
   * `gulp watch`
