# Basey Static

Basey is a developer-friendly static site boilerplate built with [UIkit](https://github.com/uikit/uikit) and [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com).

## Customization: Getting Started

* Make sure you have the following installed:
  * [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)
  * [Bower](http://bower.io)
  * [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)
* In your terminal, navigate to your site's directory and run the following:
  * `bower install`
    * Installs necessary frontend assets
  * `npm install`
    * Installs Gulp and Gulp plugins for compiling assets
  * `gulp`
     * Builds initial project
   * `gulp watch`
     * Launches an instance of BrowserSync and watches for project changes

Enjoy!
